# Improper API Response Handling and Missing Exception Handling in Dart

This repository showcases a common coding error in Dart applications involving API calls: insufficient error handling. The `bug.dart` file demonstrates the flawed code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides an improved version with robust error handling and type checking.

## Bug Description

The original code attempts to fetch data from an API. However, it lacks proper error handling for various scenarios:

1. **Missing Key:**  It assumes the API response will always contain a specific key ('key').  If the key is absent, it will throw an exception.
2. **Network Errors:**  It doesn't handle network errors (like `SocketException`) specifically, leading to generic error messages.
3. **Data Parsing Errors:** It doesn't handle JSON decoding errors (`FormatException`).
4. **HTTP Errors:** It only checks for a status code of 200. Other HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500) aren't handled appropriately.

## Solution

The improved code in `bugSolution.dart` addresses these issues by:

1. **Checking for Key Existence:** Before accessing `jsonData['key']`, it verifies that the key exists using `jsonData.containsKey('key')`.
2. **Handling Specific Exceptions:** It uses `try-catch` blocks to handle `FormatException`, `SocketException`, and other potential exceptions more gracefully.
3. **Checking HTTP Status Codes:** It checks for various HTTP status codes to provide more informative error messages.
4. **Type Safety:** Improves type safety by specifying the expected type of `jsonData` where possible.

This example highlights the importance of thorough error handling and type safety when working with external APIs in Dart.
